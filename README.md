# James Person's GitHub Pages... Page.

James Person's personal site.

See src/about.md for more info on the site's creation.

To run locally:

1. Clone the repository locally. Or make a fork and clone that.
2. Ensure you have NPM and node installed
    * This can be a hassle on Windows, you might consider using WSL or Docker to get around using Powershell
    * (I'll add Docker instructions and a default configuration some day I promise)
3. `npm i` to install dependencies
4. `npm run start` to run the startup scripts
5. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to view the development site
    * Changes you make are reloaded in the browser automatically

You don't need any environment variables to run the site properly. There are no API keys or anything.

If you do actually follow these steps, feel free to reach out with any questions! Or even if you don't. I like answering questions.
