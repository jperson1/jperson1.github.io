# TODO

## Content
- [ ] Projects/experience page. Use collections for easy addition and removal.
- [ ] Contact page? Built out with a form, perhaps. Likely not.

## Components
- [ ] BREADCRUMBS

## Refactoring
- [ ] Break `.eleventy.js` into more files in `./eleventy_config/`
- [ ] Make all the purples the same purple. Favicon, buttons, text. 
- [ ] Remove the duplication in the header, footer, contacts pages. There don't need to be four cases for linkage there.

## Workflow
- [ ] Add a linter and formatting rules


# DONE
- [x] Fix mobile formatting for codeblocks
- [x] One spot for icons, and a method of importing them
- [x] Enable automatic deploys eventually
- [x] Redirects


# NO, ACTUALLY
- [ ] Sidenav for site docs
